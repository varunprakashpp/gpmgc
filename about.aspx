                        This institution was formally inaugurated in September 1980 by Sri. E K Nayanar, the then Chief Minister of Kerala in the presence of Sri. R Gundu Rao, the then Chief Minister of Karnataka. Sri. Baby John, Minister of Education, Govt. of Kerala, Dr. A Subba Rao, Minister of Irrigation, Govt. of Kerala and Sri. Veerappa Moily, Minister of Finance, Govt. of Karnataka. For over a year since the inception, the college functioned in the 'Vanabhojanasala' belonging to Sreemad Anantheshwara Temple. In October 1981, it was shifted to the semi finished building constructed in the compound of the late poet by the sponsoring committee of the college. In October 1990, the college got transferred to the present and permanent abode in the Hosabettu village of Manjeshwar, which forms the northern border of Kerala State. The college is about 25 km from Kasaragod, the district headquarters and 17 km away from the port city of Mangalore in Karnataka. The nearest railway station is Manjeshwar, hardly 1 km away from the campus.
                        <br /><br />
Affiliated to Kannur Universirty, GPM Govt. College is the sole Arts and Science College in the northern part of Kasaragod district. The college has the distinction of being included in the 2 (f) and 12 (B) categories by the University Grants Commission. Despite several infrastructural inadequacies, it has played a pivotal part in the educational and cultural advancement of the area. The students of eight panchayaths – Manjeshwar, Mangalpady, Paivalika, Meencha, Kumbla, Mogral puthur, Puthige, Enmakaje and Vorkady – hinge upon this college in their academic pursuits. There are as many as fifteen higher secondary schools in the northern side of Kasaragod District and the students passing out from these institutions have to seek admission to this college. Financially backward, they are unable to pursue higher studies in various private educational institutions in Mangalore.

GPM Government College, Manjeshwaram has been sanctified by the name of the legendary literary luminary Rashtrakavi Manjeshwaram Govinda Pai. He was an erudite scholar, gifted poet, polyglot and multi faceted genius. He has substantially enriched diverse branches of Kannada literature. His creative compositions contain lofty ideals of secularism, humanism and universal brotherhood. It is gratifying to note that the staff and students of the college imbibe and uphold these noble ideals. No wonder, GPM Govt. College is a befitting monument designed to perpetuate the fond memories of the noble soul.

Replete with trees and plants, the campus is highly eco friendly. The college keeps up a vibrant intellectual atmosphere where teaching – learning process takes place. The system of discipline is also exemplary. Despite being economically and socially backward, the students of the college perform well in academic sphere and also in fields of arts and sports.
